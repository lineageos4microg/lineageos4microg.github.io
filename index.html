        <h2>Installation instructions</h2>
      </header>
      <section>
        <p>This ROM has few changes from the official LineageOS
        ROM, so you can follow the installation guide for your
        device on the <a href=
        "https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/">LineageOS
        wiki</a>.</p>Before installing the ZIP you should check
        that it has the correct signature. With 14.1 you can use
        keytool:
        <pre>
        <code>keytool -list -printcert -jarfile lineage-microG.zip</code></pre>
        <p>the printed fingerprints should match with these
        ones</p>
        <pre><code>Certificate fingerprints:
MD5:    54:73:70:C6:4B:FE:31:88:ED:18:F5:DF:1E:08:EB:19
SHA1:   C1:BE:BA:F7:9A:57:74:B7:5B:82:D5:0A:36:60:24:99:00:98:5D:C7

        With 15.1 and 16.0, you have to use a Python script to verify the
        signature, <a
        href="https://github.com/lineageos4microg/update_verifier">
        available here</a>.
        Install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">Python 3
        </a> (if not already done) and the required packages (as
        explained in the  <a
        href="https://github.com/lineageos4microg/update_verifier">
        README</a>), then run:

        <h3 id="migration">Migration from LineageOS</h3>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Clean install (wipe data and installed apps)</h4>
        <p>If you don't care about losing your current data just
        reboot into recovery, wipe System, Data, Cache and Dalvik
        and, without rebooting, install LineageOS for microG.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Dirty install (keep data and installed apps)</h4>
        <p>Our ROM and LineageOS use different signing keys, so you
        can't flash our ROM on top of the official LineageOS while
        keeping your data; however, the procedure needed to migrate
        from the official LineageOS is very simple.</p>
        <p>You can use our <a href=
        "https://download.lineage.microg.org/extra">migration
        ZIP</a>, that replaces the LineageOS' keys with ours.
        However, if you have installed <b>unofficial</b> builds
        of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>F-Droid or F-Droid Privileged Extension</li>
          <li>microG's apps (GmsCore, GsfProxy, FakeStore and
          mapsv1 API)</li>
          <li>MozillaNlpBackend</li>
          <li>NominatimNlpBackend</li>
        </ul>
        <p>you have to uninstall them before the ROM migration. You
        also have to uninstall the GApps if you have previously
        installed them.</p>
        <p>Then, download <a href=
        "https://download.lineage.microg.org/extra">the migration
        ZIP</a> and <a href=
        "https://download.lineage.microg.org/">a build of LineageOS
        for microG</a> (make sure the ZIP you're installing is
        newer than the current installed ROM, if it is not, wait
        for the next build), reboot in recovery, install the
        migration ZIP and, without rebooting, install LineageOS for
        microG.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Upgrade from LineageOS 15.1 to LineageOS 16.0</h3>
        <p>To upgrade from LineageOS for microG 15.1 to LineageOS
        for microG 16.0 it is not necessary to wipe your data, just
        upgrade your TWRP bootloader and flash manually the latest
        LineageOS for microG 16.0 zip.</p>
        <p>To upgrade from LineageOS 15.1 to LineageOS for microG
        16.0, first upgrade your TWRP bootloader, then upgrade to
        LineageOS 16.0 and finally follow the <a href=
        "#migration">Migration from LineageOS</a> instructions.</p>
        <p>To upgrade from an unofficial LineageOS build to
        LineageOS for microG 16.0, a factory reset is required,
        otherwise you can <a href=
        "https://lineage.microg.org/#faq16">create your own
        migration zip</a>, and follow the <a href=
        "#migration">Migration from LineageOS</a> instructions.</p>

      <header class="major">
        <h2>Post-install</h2>
      </header>
      <section>
        <p>First, open the "microG Settings" app and check if
        everything is OK in the "Self-Check" section; you will
        probably have to give microG some permissions, like
        location and file access. The UnifiedNlp section will have
        some issues: that's normal, we haven't configured it
        yet.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>UnifiedNlp</h3>
        <p>UnifiedNlp is the microG Network Location Provider,
        which provides the current location of the device without
        the use of the GPS. While Google's NLP can only use
        Google's servers for positioning, UnifiedNlp obtains the
        geolocation through different plugins, which interface to
        different services.</p>
        <p>By default there are two plugins installed:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href=
            "https://f-droid.org/packages/org.microg.nlp.backend.ichnaea/">
            MozillaNlpBackend</a>, which uses the <a href=
            "https://location.services.mozilla.com/">Mozilla
            Location Service</a> (online)
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href=
            "https://f-droid.org/packages/org.microg.nlp.backend.nominatim/">
            NominatimNlpBackend</a>, which uses MapQuest's
            Nominatim service (based on OpenStreetMap) for
            geocoding (online)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you want to use these plugins, go to microG Settings
        -&gt; UnifiedNlp Settings, configure and enable both.</p>
        <p>If you instead want different plugins (like the <a href=
        "https://f-droid.org/packages/org.fitchfamily.android.gsmlocation/">
        LocalGsmNlpBackend</a>, which uses a local offline database
        of the GSM towers to obtain the location) you can download
        them in F-Droid and enable them in the same way.</p>
        <p>Reboot and check whether UnifiedNlp is correctly set up
        in the "Self-Check" section of the "microG Settings"
        app.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>F-Droid</h3>
        <p>You have the F-Droid Privileged Extension
        installed by default, why not use it? To make a good use of
        it go to the F-Droid Settings and enable auto updates.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Google Cloud Messaging</h3>
        <p>Many apps rely on the Google Cloud Messaging, a Google
        proprietary system to push notifications to your device.
        This feature is implemented in microG but, as not every
        user requires it, is disabled by default. If you need it,
        enable the "Google Device registration" and the "Google
        Cloud Messaging" features in the "microG Settings" app.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>Weather service</h3>
        <p>If you want the weather features of LineageOS (like in
        the lock screen or in the cLock widget) you have to
        download a weather provider from <a href=
        "https://download.lineageos.org/extras">here</a>. Choose
        your favorite one, install it and configure it in cLock (or
        in Settings → Apps → Gear icon → Weather).</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h3>SU (root)</h3>
        <p>Our ROM doesn't include root by default for security
        reasons, but you can easily install it: go <a href=
        "https://download.lineageos.org/extras">here</a>, download
        the appropriate ZIP and install it from the recovery.</p>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
      </header>
      <p id="faq1"><b>Why all of this? Isn't <a href=
      "http://opengapps.org/">OpenGApps</a> free software?</b><br>
      Yes and no, the name "OpenGApps" is misleading. While
      OpenGApps <a href="https://github.com/opengapps">uses free
      software to retrieve and bundle the GApps</a>, the apps
      themselves are not free software, they are in fact the same
      Google Apps you find on a new phone.</p>
      <p id="faq2"><b>Why should I use microG instead of the
      standard Google Play Services?</b><br>
      First of all, freedom. I can't explain here why free software
      is so important (this is a FAQ, not a 200 pages manual), but
      if you're interested you can start by reading <a href=
      "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software">this</a>.<br>
      Second, the Play Services are very expensive in terms of
      resources, they drain lots of battery and they use lots of
      space, while microG requires much less resources. To give you
      an idea, the smallest possible package of OpenGApps ("Pico
      Package") on ARM 7.1 is ~125 MB, while the full microG suite
      (GmsCore, GsfProxy, FakeStore, MozillaNlpBackend and
      NominatimNlpBackend) is ~4 MB.</p>
      <p id="faq3"><b>Isn't Android free software? Can't I just
      install LineageOS without both GApps and microG?</b><br>
      Android is based on the AOSP project, which is free software.
      However many common features are handled by the proprietary
      GApps, generally by the Google Play Services. You can use
      LineageOS without GApps/microG, but you will probably miss
      something. In particular, you won't have the:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>network localization services, which means that you can
        only use the GPS for the positioning</li>
        <li>Google Cloud Messaging, so you won't receive any push
        notification for any app that relies on it</li>
        <li>the Maps API, which means that any app that uses Google
        Maps through the Maps API will probably crash</li>
      </ul>
      <p>With microG these services (and <a href=
      "https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/wiki/Implementation-Status">
      many others</a>) are reimplemented.</p>
      <p id="faq4"><b>Is LineageOS for microG completely free
      software?</b><br>
      Unfortunately no, like LineageOS it still has some non-free
      components. See the <a href=
      "https://www.replicant.us">Replicant</a> project for more
      informations.</p>
      <p id="faq5"><b>Which is the current status of microG? Which
      APIs are already implemented?</b><br>
      See <a href=
      "https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/wiki/Implementation-Status">
      here</a>.</p>
      <p id="faq6"><b>Why do we need a custom build of LineageOS to
      have microG? Can't I install microG on the official
      LineageOS?</b><br>
      MicroG requires a patch called "signature spoofing", which
      allows the microG's apps to spoof themselves as Google Apps.
      LineageOS' developers <a href=
      "https://review.lineageos.org/#/c/64967/">refused</a>
      (<a href=
      "https://review.lineageos.org/#/c/65366/">multiple</a>
      <a href="https://review.lineageos.org/#/c/195283/">times</a>)
      to include the patch, forcing us to fork their project.</p>
      <p id="faq7"><b>Wait, on their <a href=
      "https://wiki.lineageos.org/faq.html#can-you-enable-signature-spoofing">
      FAQ page</a> I see that they don't want to include the patch
      for security reasons. Is this ROM unsafe?</b><br>
      No. LineageOS' developers decided not to include this patch
      for <a href=
      "https://review.lineageos.org/#/c/195284/">various
      reasons</a>.<br>
      The signature spoofing could be an unsafe feature only if the
      user blindly gives any permission to any app, as this
      permission can't be obtained automatically by the apps.<br>
      Moreover, to further strengthen the security of our ROM, we
      modified the signature spoofing permission so that only
      system privileged apps can obtain it, and no security threat
      is posed to our users.</p>
      <p id="faq8"><b>Do you use test keys?</b><br>
      Heck, no! We sign all our builds with our own private
      keys.</p>
      <p id="faq9"><b>Do you offer OTA updates?</b><br>
      Yes, once a week.</p>
      <p id="faq10"><b>Do you offer delta updates?</b><br>
      Not currently, but it can be done if there's real demand.</p>
      <p id="faq11"><b>Can I install apps from the Play Store on
      this ROM?</b><br>
      F-Droid is included in our ROM, so you can freely download
      all the FOSS apps on their repositories.<br>
      However, if you need apps which are available only on the
      Play Store, you're free to host your personal instance of
      <a href=
      "https://github.com/NoMore201/playmaker">PlayMaker</a> or
      <a href="https://github.com/matlink/gplayweb">GPlayWeb</a>
      and connect it to your F-Droid client, which will let you
      download apps from the Play Store and install them via
      F-Droid. Another solution is to use a local app, like
      <a href="https://f-droid.org/packages/com.aurora.store/">
      Aurora Store</a>.</p>
      <p id="faq12"><b>Do I have to enable "Unknown sources" to
      install apps in F-Droid?</b><br>
      Our ROM includes "F-Droid Privileged Extension", which allows
      F-Droid to install and update apps without the need of user
      interaction or the unsafe "Unknown sources" option.</p>
      <p id="faq13"><b>Can you add support for my device? It is
      officially supported by LineageOS</b><br>
      We already build LineageOS for microG for every device
      supported by LineageOS. Find your device in our <a href=
      "https://download.lineage.microg.org/">Downloads
      page</a>!</p>
      <p id="faq14"><b>Can you add support for my device? It is not
      supported by LineageOS though...</b><br>
      No, I'm sorry.</p>
      <p id="faq15"><b>I don't trust your build, I want to build it
      myself!</b><br>
      No problem! Our builds are done with <a href=
      "https://github.com/lineageos4microg/docker-lineage-cicd">this
      Docker image</a>, feel free to build it yourself.</p>
      <p id="faq16"><b>I am running a custom build of LineageOS,
      but yours is way cooler! How can I migrate to it without
      losing my data?</b><br>
      Replace the LineageOS official keys in our <a href=
      "https://download.lineage.microg.org/extra">migration ZIP</a>
      with your keys (or follow the suggestions in the <a href=
      "https://wiki.lineageos.org/signing_builds.html#using-a-script">
      LineageOS migration guide</a>).</p>
